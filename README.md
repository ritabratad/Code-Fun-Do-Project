WATER WATER EVERYWHERE!!!

A flood is an extremely deadly disaster and tragic,especially for the millions of people who live in coastal areas. As seen during the recent floods in Kerala which led to massive loss of life as well as property. Studies show that a major cause of this devastation is the  lack of a proper alert system for the people living in such areas, as well as problems during the distribution of food and other supplies, where the authorities dont exactly know where to send the supplied.

Our project "Water Water Everywhere" aims to tackle al the major problems associated with flood, ranging from the prediction of floods to maintaining of its destructive impact and controlling it. 

The various modules in it are-
1) Prediction and Alert- Using past weather data collected, the app predicts the possibility of floods in coastal areas, and sends alert in advance to those people who live in areas where there is a chance of flood.
2) Online Contributions : People can contribute money  to the flood victims through this portal
3) Portal for NGOs : Our app connects to various NGOs and notifies them about the possibility of occurence of flood.
4) Resource Tracking and allocation : It provides an interface for the government agencies to track how much resources have been allocated to which city/district , thus ensuring proper utilization .
5) Location of Relief Camps : The app provides the location of nearby relief camps along with contact details.
6) Call for Help : If any afflicted person needs some specific requirement of resource, the app allows them to put a request . If they can't place request due to problem of internet, the nearby local agencies can place it.
